## Questions for Product

- Do you expect to have incomplete forms and give the ability to the users to continue at any stage (partial state storing)?
- Do you expect to have unique URLs for each step within the form?

## Questions for Design

- I found an error in some of your components, how your contribution process work?
- Besides the components library, do you have a design system to use across the organization?
